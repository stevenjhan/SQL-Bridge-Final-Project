Final Project â€“ Building Energy

1. Using MySQL Workbench, create a new database called BuildingEnergy. All of the work below should be completed 
in the BuildingEnergy database. The SQL script should be self-contained, such that if it runs again it will re-create the database.

2. You should first create two tables, EnergyCategories and EnergyTypes. Each energy category can have many energy types.
-- Populate the EnergyCategories table with rows for Fossil and Renewable.
-- Populate the EnergyTypes table with rows for Electricity, Gas, Steam, Fuel Oil, Solar, and Wind.
-- In the EnergyTypes table, you should indicate that Electricity, Gas, Steam, and Fuel Oil are Fossil 
energy sources, while Solar and Wind are renewable energy sources.

9a. Create the appropriate foreign key constraints.

FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS added to the EnergyTypes and BuildingInfo tables.

If a category is deleted from the EnergyCategories table, then the corresponding category ID in the EnergyTypes table is set as NULL. If
the category ID is updated in the EnergyCategories table, it is also updated witin the EnergyTypes table. 

If a building ID or energy type ID is deleted from the Buildings and EnergyTypes tables, respectively, then the row where that ID
is found in the BuildingInfo table is deleted. Likewise, if these IDs are updated, they are likewise updated within the BuildingInfo table.

9b. Create an entity relationship (ER) diagram for the tables in the database. You can sketch this by hand and
include a photo or scan if you wish.

9c. Suppose you wanted to design a set of HTML pages to manage (add, edit, and delete) the information in the
various database tables; create a mockup of the user interface (on paper or using a package like Balsamiq
Mockups).

9d. Suppose you want to track changes over time in energy type preferences in New York City buildings. What
information should you add to each table? What might a report that shows the trends over time look like?
